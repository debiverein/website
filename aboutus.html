Being 'Bangali'
At DeBI we are not just Bongs but an eclectic mix of people across India, with an aim to provide a platform for Indian expats in Germany to come together and forge long lasting relationships full of warmth and mutual respect


Creating 'memories'
We aim to not just have mere “events”, but seek to embrace the uniqueness of our homelands diversity across cultures, cuisines, and of course, experiences- all this while we stand next to one another in this faraway land.

The 2nd 'Home'
As they say, “absence makes the heart grow fonder” - we realise that we all have left a family back in India when we started our journey here. Naturally, having a warm & cozy community here is paramount. To have that taste of familiar cuisines to speaking our mother tongue unabashed, we seek to bring this warmth - and build a second home for all.
