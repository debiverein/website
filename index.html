        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by Gurudev Rabindra Tagore's immortal lines, 'Amra Shobai
          Raja' (We're all kings) - We a group of expatriates Bengalis have
          gathered together under the umbrella of DeBI e.V - to collectively
          forster and promote Bengali culture and heritage in Germany. Come, let
          us get together and make our own stores !!!.
        </p>
        <h3>Being 'Bangali'</h3>
        <p>
          At DeBI we are not just Bongs but an eclectic mix of people across
          India, with an aim to provide a platform for Indian expats in Germany
          to come together and forge long lasting relationships full of warmth
          and mutual respect
        </p>
        <h3>Creating 'memories'</h3>
        <p>
          We aim to not just have mere “events”, but seek to embrace the
          uniqueness of our homelands diversity across cultures, cuisines, and
          of course, experiences- all this while we stand next to one another in
          this faraway land.
        </p>
        <h3>The 2nd 'Home'</h3>
        <p>
          As they say, “absence makes the heart grow fonder” - we realise that
          we all have left a family back in India when we started our journey
          here. Naturally, having a warm & cozy community here is paramount. To
          have that taste of familiar cuisines to speaking our mother tongue
          unabashed, we seek to bring this warmth - and build a second home for
          all.
